# Mycelial Webinar Exercise

## Goal

Finish creating the real-time, collaborative, command line todos app.

## Instructions

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Review the `API.md` docs file as needed
3. Open the `index.mjs` file, and complete each TODO comment
4. When you've finished, execute the following 
   command in two separate terminals `node index.mjs <namespace>` namespace
   should be a string, and you should use the same value in both terminals
5. If the application works properly, you can add/remove todo items in either
   terminal and they will be replicated to the other terminal

## Stuck?

You can see the completed exercise in the file `completed.mjs`
